# EquaTeX
### An equation editor for MacOS

This software aims to be a mix between MathType and LaTeXiT, offering
the interface of the first and the power of the second, plus syntax
coloring and copy-paste back AND forth from Apple iWork suite.

If you feel there is a missing feature you would definitely want to
have, let me know, or better, provide a patch ;)
